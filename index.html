                    <ul>
                        <li>Mapped several Northern California beaches with a multispectral
                            sensor mounted on a UAV and collected ground control points.</li>
                        <li>Processed the resulting data into many deliverable types including orthophotos,
                            calibrated reflectance layers and digital elevation maps.</li>
                        <li>Aided in classification of local flora and fauna in the intertidal region.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>University of Northern Colorado/City of Longmont</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Similar to Point Reyes, we mapped a stretch of the Saint Vrain Creek in Longmont, CO.
                        for a UNC group. The goal was to aid in assessing the reconstruction efforts since the
                        2013 flood and to set a baseline for future research.</li>
