    <h1>Post-Flood Reconstruction Assessment</h1>
    <p>In 2013, a devastating flood tore through Northern Colorado, wreaking havoc on local ecologies. 
The area surrounding the St. Vrain Creek, an important waterway running through Longmont, was hit especially hard. 
Post-flood, the Dickens Farm Nature Area was redesigned for public use, with walkways and easy water access, while other 
areas focused on ecological restoration. To aid a team from the University of Northern Colorado in assessing the progress 
and effectiveness of reconstruction efforts in the region, we carefully mapped a 2+ mile stretch of the creek. 
We used a UAV-mounted multispectral camera, along with a ground-based Trimble unit to collect ground control points and 
achieved accuracy in the cm range. Our deliverables included high-quality orthophotos, digital elevation models (DEMs), 
normalized difference vegitation index (NDVI) layers, and point clouds, 
some of which you are seeing here. These maps contain information crucial for ecologists to gauge current progress and 
will serve as a baseline for future studies, allowing for comparisons between different sites with their unique 
reconstruction objectives.</p>
