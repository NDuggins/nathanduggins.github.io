Winner of the peoples choice award at the 2024 GISCO conference, this relative elevation map (REM) gives us a glimpse into 
the many paths this river has taken throughout its history. The elevation has been set relative to the centerline of the main 
river channels and we are looking back in time at the ghosts of former stream channels. 
REMs are an important tool that ecologists and conservationists can use to glean insight into the worlds they are attempting 
to peak into.
