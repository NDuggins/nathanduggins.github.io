This mapping project at Point Reyes National Park involved using UAV technology and multispectral sensors to create detailed maps of Northern California beaches. The project included collecting ground control points, processing data into orthophotos, calibrated reflectance layers, and digital elevation maps. The results aided in creating classification rasters highlighting different local flora and fauna in the park's intertidal regions.
