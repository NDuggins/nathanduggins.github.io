This innovative mapping project at Point Reyes National Seashore showcases the cutting-edge application of unmanned 
aerial vehicle (UAV) 
technology and multispectral sensors in coastal ecosystem monitoring. Focusing on four distinct beaches within 
this protected California landscape, our team leveraged advanced remote sensing techniques to create  
high-resolution maps of these dynamic intertidal zones.

Our methodology combined precision UAV flights, timed with the lowest tides, and accurate ground control points to 
produce high-accuracy, high-resolution orthophotos and elevation models. The integration of multispectral imagery 
allowed us to differentiate between visually similar surface types, such as mussels and algae - crucial indicators of 
ecosystem health. Using supervised classification algorithms, we developed comprehensive maps of species distribution 
across these complex coastal environments.
